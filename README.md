# Image-based-Diabetic-Retinopathy
#introduction
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes. 
It can develop in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and usually affects both eyes.
People with retinopathy have damaged blood vessels in their retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eyes.
